Monolithic Architecture
1.Completely developed in a single programming language.
2.It has only a single codebase.
3.It is very difficult to understand, and it is confusing.
4.Application scaling is very difficult as the entire application should be scaled.
5.It has a centralized data model.

Microservice Architecture
1.Every service can be independently developed using different programming languages.
2.It has multiple codebases. Every service has a separate codebase for them.
3.It has high understandability and is very easy to maintain.
4.Application scaling is very easy as each service can be scaled separately without scaling of the entire application.
5.It has a federated data model, allowing each service to adopt its own data model.
