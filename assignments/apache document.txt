Why apache server
Apache is open-source software, which means that the source code can be viewed and collaborated for free. 
The basic job of all web servers is to accept requests from clients (e.g. a visitorâ€™s web browser) and then send the response to that request (e.g. the components of the page that a visitor wants to see).
